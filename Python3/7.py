# This is a simple Python script to explain built-in functions and data types with a practical example.

# Example: Working with strings and numbers

# Strings
# Create a string
my_string = "Hello, Python!"

# Print the string
print("Original String:", my_string)

# Use the len() function to get the length of the string
string_length = len(my_string)
print("Length of String:", string_length)

# Use the upper() method to convert the string to uppercase
uppercased_string = my_string.upper()
print("Uppercased String:", uppercased_string)

# Use the lower() method to convert the string to lowercase
lowercased_string = my_string.lower()
print("Lowercased String:", lowercased_string)

# Numbers
# Create a list of numbers
my_numbers = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1]

# Use the sum() function to calculate the sum of the numbers
sum_of_numbers = sum(my_numbers)
print("Sum of Numbers:", sum_of_numbers)

# Use the max() function to find the maximum number
max_number = max(my_numbers)
print("Maximum Number:", max_number)

# Use the min() function to find the minimum number
min_number = min(my_numbers)
print("Minimum Number:", min_number)

# Comments to explain the example:
# - Created a string 'my_string' and a list of numbers 'my_numbers'.
# - Used the len() function to get the length of the string.
# - Used the upper() and lower() methods to convert the string to uppercase and lowercase, respectively.
# - Used the sum(), max(), and min() functions to perform calculations on the list of numbers.

# Exercise 1 (Incomplete): Manipulate a string
# The learner needs to complete the code to manipulate the given string.

# Given string
exercise_string = "Welcome to Python!"

# Incomplete: The learner needs to modify the code to perform string manipulations such as changing case or extracting a substring.

# Exercise 2 (Buggy): Calculate the average of a list of numbers
# The learner needs to fix the bug in the code to correctly calculate the average of the given list of numbers.

# Given list of numbers
exercise_numbers = [10, 5, 8, 12, 6]

# Buggy: The learner needs to fix the code to correctly calculate the average of the numbers.

# End of the script
# Encourage the learner to run the script, fix the exercises, and understand various built-in functions and data types in Python.
